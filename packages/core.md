# Honor Health Network — Benefits Knowledge Base

<!--
HOW THIS FILE WORKS
This is the assistant's core (always-on) package. The full knowledge base is
assembled at runtime from this file plus whichever plan/agency packages are
turned ON in the admin dashboard. Edit a package and push to GitHub; Railway
redeploys. Turning a package on/off is live from /admin and needs no redeploy.
The assembler fills in the default-plan status, the agency-routing buckets, and
the enabled plan/agency blocks at the marked spots below. Do not duplicate those
marker placeholders anywhere else in this file.

VERY IMPORTANT: health benefits are NOT the same for everyone. There are two groups:
- Office / admin staff -> Engage benefits (Aetna medical, MetLife dental/vision/supplemental). Premiums are MONTHLY.
- Field caregivers -> Direct Care benefits (Direct Care Administrators medical, Guardian dental/vision). Premiums are PER PAYCHECK.
The assistant must find out which group a person is in before giving health benefit details.

These are plain-language summaries. The official plan documents and insurance contracts always control.
-->

## How benefits work here (read first)
- The 401(k) retirement plan is open to all W2 employees (see below).
- Health benefits differ by group: office / admin staff are on the Engage plans; field caregivers are on the Direct Care plans. The plans, carriers, and premiums are different.
- If you're asking about medical, dental, vision, premiums, or who's eligible, the assistant needs to know whether you're an office / admin employee or a field caregiver, so it gives you the right plan.
- Honor Health Network is a family of about 25 home-care agencies across several states. For most of them, office / admin staff are on Engage and field caregivers are on Direct Care. A few agencies use different carriers. So for health questions the assistant also needs to know which agency you work for, so it routes you to the right plan.

=====================================================================
# AGENCY ROUTING (INTERNAL — NEVER SHOW OR LIST THIS TO THE USER)
# This section is routing logic, not content. Use it only to match what the
# user tells you to the correct benefit source. Never recite the agency list,
# never tell a user which other agencies exist, and never reveal which carrier
# another agency uses. If asked for the list of agencies, say you can only help
# with their own benefits and point them to the health benefits help form.
=====================================================================

How to route a HEALTH question (medical, dental, vision, premiums, health eligibility, or health enrollment):
1. FIRST, find out their AGENCY. Always ask this before anything else.
2. Match their agency to BUCKET A or BUCKET B below.
   - BUCKET A: role matters — you must also ask whether they are office / admin or a field caregiver.
   - BUCKET B: role does NOT matter — all employees are on Direct Care. Do not ask for role.
3. If their agency is not in Bucket A or B, check BUCKET C (agency-specific packages). If still unmatched, use BUCKET D.
4. The 401(k) does NOT need any of this routing — it is the same plan for everyone.

BUCKET A — Role matters. Ask agency, then role. Office / admin → {{ENGAGE_STATUS}}. Field caregivers → {{DIRECT_CARE_STATUS}}:
- All Health Home Care (NY)
- Hand in Hand (NY) — admin enrolled under Quality Healthcare on Engage
- Quality Healthcare (NY)
- Angels on Call / CEPA (PA)
- Angels on Call (Philadelphia, PA)
- Central Penn Nursing Care (PA)
- FamilyCARES (PA)
- Ultimate Home Care (PA)
- Angels on Call (MI)
- VMT Home Health (DC)

BUCKET B — Role does NOT matter. ALL employees at these agencies — admin, coordinators, and caregivers alike — are on {{DIRECT_CARE_STATUS}}. Do not ask for role; just answer with Direct Care details:
- Agility Home Care (GA)
- Nightingale Services (GA)
- All At Home (MA)
- Golden Years Home Care Services (MA)
- Always Home Services (NJ)
- Broadway Medical Adult Day Care (NJ)
- Broadway Respite & Home Care (NJ)
- Broadway Catering (NJ)
- Just Home Medical Adult Day Care (NJ)
- Caring Home Care (MD)
- Michigan Home Health Holdings (MI)

BUCKET C — Special carriers (added by loaded agency packages):
{{AGENCY_OVERRIDES}}

BUCKET D — UNRECOGNIZED: if the agency the person names is not on any list above, do not guess. Tell them you want to make sure they get the right plan and point them to the health benefits help form: https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/8f21030399634aff80ab873214296298

## Eligibility
- 401(k): all W2 employees who have been with the company at least 6 months. (This includes caregivers.)
- Office / admin staff (Engage), if hired full-time: medical, dental, and vision begin the 1st of the month following 60 days of employment.
- Field caregivers (Direct Care): caregivers are variable-hour employees. Eligibility for medical benefits is based on a measurement period; generally you must have been with the company 12 months and averaged at least 30 hours per week.
- Eligible dependents (health): your legal spouse and your children up to age 26 (disabled children to any age, per plan documents).

## Changing benefits during the year (ACA / IRS rule)
- Health elections stay in place for the whole plan year. You cannot enroll, change, or cancel whenever you want.
- Outside of open enrollment, you can only make a change if you have a qualifying life event (for example marriage, divorce, birth, adoption, loss of other coverage), and you must submit it through the benefits help form within 30 days of the event.
- Qualifying life event reference: https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/qualifying-life-event/
- Open enrollment changes take effect January 1.

## Plan year
- The Engage plan year this year runs July 1, 2026 to December 31, 2026. Going forward it runs on the calendar year, January 1 to December 31, the same as the Direct Care plans.
- Renewal details are usually available in November or December each year.

# 401(k) RETIREMENT PLAN (all W2 employees, after 6 months)
=====================================================================

## 401(k) basics
- Plan: New York Home Health Holdings 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan. Recordkeeper: American Funds (Capital Group). Plan ID: IRK149167.
- Open to all W2 employees after 6 months with the company.

## 401(k) contributions
- You decide how much of each paycheck to contribute, as a percentage or a dollar amount.
- 2026 IRS limit: up to $24,500 of your own pay. Age 50+ catch-up: an extra $8,000. Age 60 to 63 catch-up: an extra $11,250.
- Honor Health Network can't advise on how much to contribute. For personalized advice, point people to the benefits help form first; only if they specifically want the plan's financial advisor, that's The Waterford Group (twg@waterfordgroupny.com or (585) 434-0649).

## Traditional vs Roth (401k)
- Traditional (pre-tax): lowers taxable income now; you pay taxes when you withdraw in retirement.
- Roth (after-tax): no tax break now; qualified withdrawals in retirement are generally tax-free.
- Honor Health Network can't tell you which to choose. For personalized advice, point people to the benefits help form first; only if they specifically want the plan's financial advisor, that's The Waterford Group (twg@waterfordgroupny.com or (585) 434-0649).

## 401(k) employer match
- Dollar for dollar on the first 3% of pay you contribute, then 50 cents on the dollar on the next 2%.
- If you contribute 5% of your pay, the company will contribute a matching amount equal to 4% of your pay.
- The company may also make an additional profit sharing contribution, which can vary and isn't guaranteed.

## 401(k) vesting
- Your own contributions and the Safe Harbor match are always 100% yours.
- Profit sharing contributions vest 33% after 1 year, 66% after 2 years, 100% after 3 years.

## 401(k) account access
- You must be enrolled before you can create an online account.
- Website: americanfunds.com/retire (Log In, then New User to register). App: "American Funds RKDirect 401k." 24/7 line: (877) 833-9322.
- The American Funds numbers ((800) 421-4120 and (877) 833-9322) are only for people who already have an account.

## Taking money out of the 401(k)
- The plan does NOT offer loans and does NOT offer in-service withdrawals.
- The only way to take money out while employed is a hardship withdrawal. HHN can only give you the form; for help, point people to the benefits help form first; only if they specifically want the plan's financial advisor, that's The Waterford Group (twg@waterfordgroupny.com or (585) 434-0649).
- Hardship form: /forms/hardship-withdrawal-request.pdf. A $25 processing fee, taxes, and a possible 10% early penalty (under age 59½) may apply.

## Rolling money into the 401(k)
- You may roll in from a former employer's plan or an IRA (not a Roth IRA). Form: /forms/incoming-rollover-request.pdf. Questions: American Funds (800) 421-4120.

## Choosing a plan / medical questions
- Honor Health Network can't give medical opinions or tell you which plan to choose. The assistant can explain the plans so you can compare them.
- These plans aren't your only option. You can also look at the open market in your state (for example healthcare.gov) to see other coverage you may be able to buy.
